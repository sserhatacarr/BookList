# Filtering Books with Java Streams and Lambdas

This code demonstrates how to filter a list of books to select those with 350 pages or more.

## Implementation

1. Define a `Book` class with attributes such as title, page count, author, and publication date.
2. Create a list of `Book` objects, populating it with sample book data.
3. Use Java Streams and Lambda expressions to filter books with more than 350 pages.
4. Collect the filtered books into a new list.
5. Display the titles of books with 350 pages or more.

The code provides a concise way to filter books based on page count using Java Streams and Lambdas.
